summary:
  When calling Employee.find with an id or array of ids, each parameter must match a document in the database or this error will be raised. The search was for the id(s): 5a2d710a60c05c12876784ee ... (1 total) and the following ids were not found: 5a2d710a60c05c12876784ee.
resolution:
  Search for an id that is in the database or set the Mongoid.raise_not_found_error configuration option to false, which will cause a nil to be returned instead of raising this error when searching for a single id, or only the matched documents when searching for multiples.):

summary:
  When calling Employee.find with an id or array of ids, each parameter must match a document in the database or this error will be raised. The search was for the id(s): IzxBY3Rpb25EaXNwYXRjaDo6SHR0cDo6VXBsb2FkZWRGaWxlOjB4MDA1NTg0ZDI4ZjMzZTA+ ... (1 total) and the following ids were not found: IzxBY3Rpb25EaXNwYXRjaDo6SHR0cDo6VXBsb2FkZWRGaWxlOjB4MDA1NTg0ZDI4ZjMzZTA+.
resolution:
  Search for an id that is in the database or set the Mongoid.raise_not_found_error configuration option to false, which will cause a nil to be returned instead of raising this error when searching for a single id, or only the matched documents when searching for multiples.):

summary:
  When calling Employee.find with an id or array of ids, each parameter must match a document in the database or this error will be raised. The search was for the id(s): 5a316a2f60c05c5fe499969f ... (1 total) and the following ids were not found: 5a316a2f60c05c5fe499969f.
resolution:
  Search for an id that is in the database or set the Mongoid.raise_not_found_error configuration option to false, which will cause a nil to be returned instead of raising this error when searching for a single id, or only the matched documents when searching for multiples.):
